This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  The `bug.php` file shows code that uses these functions, resulting in errors. The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to correct this using MySQLi.  This is important because the `mysql_*` functions are no longer supported and will cause issues in many PHP environments.  The solution uses the more secure and modern MySQLi extension.
